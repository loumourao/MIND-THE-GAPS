# MIND THE GAPS

MIND THE GAPS is an open-source project that focuses on the generation of geometric datasets for experimenting with Machine Learning-based collision detection. It includes:

1. **`geometry`**: A package for geometric manipulation primitives;
2. **`generative_functions`**: A package for dataset generation routines;
3. **`interactions`**: A package for collision detection utilities;
4. **`machine_learning`**: A package that handles dataset managers and Machine Learning model definitions;
5. **`collidium`**: A meta-package that aggregates the aforementioned packages;
6. A collection of **Jupyter notebooks** for training and testing Machine Learning models for collision detection.

This project is in its early stages and draws great inspiration from the geometric notations and functionalities of [Khepri](https://algorithmicdesign.github.io/tools/khepri.html): an open-source project developed by the Algorithmic Design for Architecture group (led by Professor António Menezes Leitão) at INESC-ID / Instituto Superior Técnico.
